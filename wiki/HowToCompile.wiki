#summary How To Compile the source code
#labels Compile

= Checking out =

To checkout get the SVN Client.
http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads

= Setting Up =

Goto the downloads tab above (http://code.google.com/p/jmnvc/downloads/list) and download the LATEST RakNet Dependencies, "RakNet_RXXXX.exe".
Open the installer and browse to where you checked out the source code
Example, "C:\source\JVCMP\Main" where "C:\source\JVCMP" is the checkout folder.
So you must add the "\Main" on the end or the installer will put it in the wrong folder!
Please re-apply dependicys if they get deleted, check when you update the source code that "RakNet" exists if it doesnt then apply the dependicys again.
